### Sample Launch Tweet/Post
```
Just shipped Parse DMARC - an open source DMARC report parser
that doesn't require Elasticsearch.

- Single 14MB Docker image
- Built-in dashboard (no Kibana needed)
- Prometheus metrics included
- SQLite storage

Stop drowning in XML reports.

github.com/meysam81/parse-dmarc
```

### LinkedIn Post Structure
```
I built an open source tool to solve a problem that frustrated me for years.

DMARC reports are essential for email security, but:
- They arrive as compressed XML
- Existing tools need Elasticsearch + Kibana
- Setup takes hours, not minutes

So I built Parse DMARC:
- Single 14MB binary
- Vue.js dashboard included
- Prometheus metrics for prod
- Zero external dependencies

Open source. Apache-2.0 licensed.
